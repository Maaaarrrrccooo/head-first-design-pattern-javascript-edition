# Head First Design Pattern Typescript Edition

This project converts the code from the book head first design pattern from java to typescript language. Some of the codes here are direct copy while some are not in here due to language limitation of typescript. Eg. Java class enums vs typescript enums, synchronized keyword on method call, etc. Also this project does not follow the best practices since the main purpose of this project is to study about the patterns.
