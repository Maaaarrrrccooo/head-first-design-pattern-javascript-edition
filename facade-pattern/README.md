# Facade Pattern

The facade pattern makes complex interface calls simpler. while at the same time allows exposure of the complex interfaces.

NOTE: a facade can be both dumb and smart. dumb where it acts like a pass through and smart when it can compose logic to know the sequences.

The design principle of least knowledge is applied to facade where you only limit object interactions to just a few close.
