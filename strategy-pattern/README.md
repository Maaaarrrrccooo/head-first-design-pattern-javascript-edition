# Strategy Pattern

Strategy pattern is a behavioral design pattern where it allows you to select different algorithms during runtime. Strategy pattern helps your code to be easily manageable and extendable. It uses composition instead of inheritance when constructing the pattern. In this pattern behaviors are defined in an interface while implementation will be its own specific classes that will these interfaces. A behavior can be changed without it breaking classes that uses it.
